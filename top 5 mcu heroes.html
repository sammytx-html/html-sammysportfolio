<h1>Top 5 MCU Heroes (according to Samuel)</h1>
<h2>Warning: It's My Opinion</h2>
<hr />
<h3>5. Captain America</h3>
<p>If I were doing a top 10 list, he probably wouldn't even be no.5. I just couldn't think of any other Hero that's better right now and I'm frankly too lazy to.</p>
<h3>4. Hulk (Pre-Endgame)</h3>
<p>The Hulk, before endgame nerfed his a**, was on a generational run. He meant business in his raging and tantrums. I know the MCU writers or directors, or 
    whoever was in charge of the plot, had always foreshadowed that Bruce and the Hulk would not be so against each other and would learn to coexist. Do i care though? No.
    I can go on about why I dislike the decision but this is a top 5 list.</p>
<h3>3. Thor</h3>
<p>Thor, the God of Thunder. He's so goated with how funny, strong and charismatic he is in all the movies he appears in. Of course, endgame had nerfed his a** too by 
    making him fat AF but that was reedeemed in later movies. (Love and Thunder is still an a** movie btw)</p>
<h3>2. Spiderman</h3>
<p>I'm not gonna lie, if you have spiderman lower in your top 5 list, I wouldn't blame you. I have him this high because I'm biased towards spiderman. I also think the
    the spiderman movies are very good and enjoyable (especially far from home). Spiderman's character has developed so well and i really hope the n****s who are incharge of
    MCU movie plots don't ruin him like they've done every other GOOD character post endgame. (Except Loki surprisingly)</p>
<h3>1. IRON MAN</h3>
<p>If Iron man isn't at least in your top 3 MCU heroes, your list is automatically invalid. (And I'm saying top 3 and not the very no.1 because I understand you can have biases
    and whatever) Being the face of the MCU for being the kick off movie AND the most popular character in the MCU, Iron man is easily my no.1. (RIP Tony, I love you 3000)
